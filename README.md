Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks.

If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 
 
- Input:

  N = 4

  arr[] = {7,4,0,9}
  
- Output: 
  
  10

- Explanation: 

  Water trapped by above 
  
  block of height 4 is 3 units and above 
  
  block of height 0 is 7 units. So, the 
  
  total unit of water trapped is 10 units
